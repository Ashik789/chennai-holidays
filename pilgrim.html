<h4>TOP DESTINATIONS</h4>
<p><strong>Haridwar</strong><hr>Haridwar is the gateway to the four pilgrimages of Uttaranchal. It’s also your starting point on the journey to the sacred sources of the rivers Ganga and the Yamuna. According to legend, Prince Bhagirath performed penance here to salvage the souls of his ancestors who had perished due to sage Kapil’s curse. The penance was answered and the river. Ganga trickled forth from Lord Shiva's locks and its bountiful water revived the sons of King Sagara.</p>
<p><strong>Gangotri</strong><hr>The Gangotri temple was constructed in the early 18th century by a Gorkha Commander Amar Sigh Thapa. The existing temple is said to be the one reconstructed by the Jaipur dynasty. Every year thousands of pilgrims through the sacred shrine between May & October. The Pujaris & brahmins are from the village of Mukhwa. The water from Gangotri is carried to offer to Lord Shiva. It is believed that this water has amrit (nectar) in it and will soothe the throat of Shiva who gulp the poison.</p>
<p><strong>Lakshman Jhula</strong><hr>Lakshman Jhula, the famous hanging bridge across Ganga, is about 3 km from the main township of Rishikesh. It is 450 feet long and is situated at a height of 70 feet from the river. As per mythological tales, once Lakshman, the younger brother of Lord Rama, crossed river Ganga at the same site where the bridge now stands. At that time, there was only a suspension bridge, made of jute. After this incident, the bridge came to be known as ‘Lakshman Jhula’. With time, the jute bridge eroded and a new iron bridge was built along the same path in 1939.</p>
<p><strong>Yamunotri</strong><hr>The sacred shrine of Yamunotri, source of the river Yamuna, is the westernmost shrine in the Garhwal Himalayas, perched atop a flank of Bandar Poonch Parvat. The chief attraction at Yamunotri is the temple devoted to goddess Yamuna and the holy thermal springs at Jankichatti (7 km. Away). The Yamunotri temple is on the left bank of Yamuna constructed by Maharaja Pratap Shah of Tehri Garhwal. The deity is made of black marble.</p>

<h4>TOP DESTINATIONS</h4>
<p><strong>Haridwar</strong><hr>Haridwar is the gateway to the four pilgrimages of Uttaranchal. It's also your starting point on the journey to the sacred sources of the rivers Ganga and the Yamuna. According to legend, Prince Bhagirath performed penance here to salvage the souls of his ancestors who had perished due to sage Kapil's curse. The penance was answered and the river. Ganga trickled forth from Lord Shiva's locks and its bountiful water revived the sons of King Sagara.</p>
<p><strong>Guptkashi</strong><hr> Guptkashi has a great importance quite like that of Kashi. The ancient Vishwanath temple, Ardhnareshwar temple and Manikarnik Kund, where the two streams of Ganga and Yamuna are believed to meet, are the main places of attraction in Guptkashi.</p>
<p><strong>Rishikesh</strong><hr>Rishikesh is a small town in the northern state of Uttarakhand in India. Scenically located where the Ganges River comes down from the Himalayas, Rishikesh catapulted to Western fame when the Beatles dropped by for a visit to Maharishi Mahesh Yogi's ashram (now closed), and the town is still known as the World Capital of Yoga.
Rishikesh is also the Gateway to the Himalayas. The Char Dham Yatra (Four Shrines Sacred Journey) ideally begins from Rishikesh.</p>
<p><strong>Kedarnath</strong><hr>Kedarnath is the seat of Lord Shiva. It is one of the twelve "<strong>Jyotirlingas</strong>" of Lord Shiva. Lying at an altitude of 3584 m at the head of river Mandakini, the shrine of <strong>Kedarnath Temple</strong> is amongst the holiest pilgrimage for the Hindus. It is no wonder that Adi Guru Shankaracharya- a great scholar & saint, chose to enshrine Lord Shiva in this land, where the unholy becomes oly and the holy becomes holier. </p>
<p><strong>Delhi</strong><hr>Delhi, has seen the rise and fall of many empires which have left behind a plethora of monuments that the grandeur and glory of bygone ages. A city which traces its history to Mahabharata, the great epic tale of wars fought between estranged cousins, the Kauravas and the Pandavas for the city of Indraprastha.</p>

It is one of the most important places of worship for Hindus and is often referred to as "Bhooloka Vaikuntam" which translates to the holy abode of Vishnu on Earth. The divine idol installed here represents the enchanting form of Sree Krishna endowed with the four lustrous arms carrying the conch Panchajanya, the discus Sudarshana Chakra, the mace Kaumodaki and the lotus.</p>
<p><strong>Kadampuzha Bhagavathi Temple</strong><hr>Kadampuzha literally should mean Kadam river. The fact is otherwise; there is no river at all. The deity here is goddess Durga, who, it is believed possesses immense curative and rewarding powers. Besides thousands of pilgrims coming
daily to seek blessings, hundreds of new vehicles too come here to seek blessings to ward off mishaps during their life in the roads.Though the temple is very famous all over Kerala, there is no major festival. The only festival, if it is a festival, is on Karthika day of Malayalam month Vrichikam (November-December). During this day there is Annadhanam (food gifting) to over 10000 devotees.</p>
<p><strong>Parassinikkadavu</strong><hr>Parassinikkadavu is noted for the famous Muthappan temple where people go for worshipping Sree Muthappan. This is the only Hindu Temple in Kerala where a Theyyam performance is a daily ritual offering. Parassinkkadavu is also noted for the Parassinikkadavu Snake Park which is committed to the preservation and conservation of snakes. There are about 150 varieties of snakes including the spectacled cobra, King cobra, Russell's viper, Krait and Pit Viper living in the park</p>
<p><strong>Thalassery Jgannath Temple</strong><hr>The temple is open to people of all religion.The Government of Kerala declared Thalassery a heritage city new circuit would cover the heritage sites such as the Thalassery Fort, the Sree Rama Temple at Thiruvangad, St. John's Anglican Church, Arakkal Kettu, Jagannatha Temple, Thalassery Pier, Ezhimala Fort, Madayi and Neeliyar Fort, the Annapoorna Temple, Thrichambaram Temple, Sree Rajarajeswari Temple at Thalipparambu, Kanjirangad Temple </p>
