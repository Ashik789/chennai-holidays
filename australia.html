<h4>TOP DESTINATIONS</h4>
<p><strong>Auckland</strong><hr> Auckland, based around 2 large harbours, is a major city in the north of New Zealand’s North Island. In central Queen Street, the iconic Sky Tower has views of Viaduct Harbour, which is full of superyachts and lined with bars and cafes. Auckland Domain, the city’s oldest park, is based around an extinct volcano and home to the formal Wintergardens. Mission Bay Beach is minutes from Downtown.</p>
<p><strong>Rotorua</strong><hr>Rotorua, a town set on its namesake lake on New Zealand's North Island, is a cultural centre for the indigenous Maori people. Te Puia cultural centre, in the Whakarewarewa valley, has geysers and thermal mud pools fueled by the area's geothermal activity, and houses the New Zealand Maori Arts and Crafts Institute. The Pohutu geyser here erupts many times daily.</p>
<p><strong>Queenstown</strong><hr>Queenstown, New Zealand, sits on the shore of the South Island’s Lake Wakatipu, set against the dramatic Southern Alps. The surrounding Central Otago region is known for its Pinot Noir and Chardonnay vineyards, and for adventure sports. In winter, there's backcountry skiing and the country’s highest vertical drops. Summer brings paragliding, mountain biking and bungee-jumping (Kawarau Gorge Suspension Bridge is among the sport's original sites).</p>
<p><strong>Christchurch</strong><hr> Christchurch is a garden city on the east coast of New Zealand’s South Island, set on the Canterbury Plains. Flat-bottomed punts glide on the Avon River, which runs through the city centre. On its banks are cycling paths, the green expanse of Hagley Park and the Christchurch Botanic Gardens. In 2010 and 2011, 2 major earthquakes destroyed many city-centre buildings, and restoration work continues. </p>
