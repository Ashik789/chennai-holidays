<h4>TOP DESTINATIONS</h4>
<p><strong>KUMBH MELA </strong><hr>The origin of the Kumbh is very old and dates back to the time when Kalasha (pot of nectar of immortality) was recovered from Samudramanthan (during the churning of the primordial sea), for which a tense war between Devtas (Gods) and Asuras (Demons) ensued. The festival is religiously most important for the Hindus. 
At every Kumbh occassion, millions of Hindus take part in the celebrations </p>
<p><strong>Trimbakeshwar</strong><hr>Trimbakeshwar temple is a religious center having one of the twelve Jyotirlingas. The extraordinary feature of the Jyotirlinga located here is its three faces embodying Lord Brahma, Lord Vishnu and Lord Rudra. Due to excessive use of water, the linga has started to erode. It is said that this erosion symbolizes the eroding nature of human society. </p>
<p><strong>Shani Shingnapur </strong><hr>Shingnapur is also famous for the fact that no house in the village has doors, only door frames. Despite this, no theft is reported in the village. Villagers never keep their valuables under lock and key. Villagers believe that the temple is a "jagrut devasthan" ( "a live temple"), meaning that the god here is very powerful. They believe that God Shani punishes 
anyone attempting theft. </p>
<p><strong>Shirdi Sai Baba</strong><hr>Shirdi Sai Baba, also known as Sai Baba of Shirdi, was an Indian guru(teacher), yogi (hermit) and fakir (preast), who has numerous Hindu and Muslim devotees and believe him to be a Saint. Hindu devotees consider him to be an incarnation
of Lord Dattastreya. Many devotees believe that he was an enlightened teacher. He is well known in many parts of the world, but especially in India, where he is much revered.  </p>
